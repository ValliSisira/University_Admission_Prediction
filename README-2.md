# University Admission Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the probability of postgraduate entry using a machine learning approach. The objective is to help graduates identify and target colleges that best align with their profiles. The developed model takes into consideration crucial factors influencing the student admission process, aiming for high accuracy. The project compares and contrasts three regression modeling strategies—linear regression, decision tree, and random forest—to predict university acceptance rates. The recommended model provides an estimation of the probability for prospective candidates to be accepted into university. The platform is open-source and freely accessible.
