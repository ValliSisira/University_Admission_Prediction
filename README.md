# University_Admission_Prediction
The project focuses on utlizing machine learning algorithms to predict university admission chances by analyzing key factors such as academic performance and extracurricular activities,

Decision tree, random forest, and linear regression algorithms are implemented and compared, with a me?culous assessment of their accuracy and efficiency in predicting admission probabilities.

A streamlined UI model is developed, offering an intutive platform for users to input their data and receive clear predictions.
